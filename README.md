This project is about making whole game by using my knowledge in SOLID and OOP.

### About this repository ###

* This is test from [Kefir](https://kefirgames.com/) studio
* Project were done by 49 hours (end point is 15.12.2022)
* I'm also planing to expand and refactor this project while my knowledges will grow

### Assigned tasks from Kefir studio ###

* Make 2D clone of original game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))
* Make chasers, asteroids, fragments of asteroids
* Make 2 types of weapons: Ray and Bullet. Ray will destroy everything on it's way. Bullets will create fragments of asteroids on hit.
* When player touches the edge of the screen, player will be teleported
* Make death screen (when player will touch chaser, asteroid, asteroid fragment)
* Make asteroids and chasers periodically appear after the start of the game
* Make UI which will show coordinates, rotation angle, speed, ray charges
